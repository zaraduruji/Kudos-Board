### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

The topics in the labs were really helpful for the basics of the assignment. Learning about React components, state management, and working with APIs was essential. However, I felt unprepared when it came to more complex tasks, like the dynamic GIF search feature. Managing API calls and handling asynchronous operations was also tougher than expected.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
With more time, I would have focused on adding the stretch feature that allows users to leave comments on cards. This would have made the project more interactive. I would also improve the user interface to make it more user-friendly and add better error handling to make the app more robust.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?
* 
The project demo went well overall. The core features worked as expected, but there were some issues with the dynamic GIF search. I noticed a peer used real-time updates, which made their app more responsive. I would like to try incorporating real-time updates next time to improve user experience.
